The next database I found was Datastax. 
It can be found at this website: https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-enterprise. 
Datastax is an open source database and utilizes a graphing data model. 
The databaseâ€™s hosting model is cloud. 
It can be accessed through java by creating a cluster object.
