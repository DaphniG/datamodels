## PostgreSQL
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)


The next database I found was PostgreSQL. 
This databaseâ€™s website can be found at https://www.postgresql.org/. 
PostgreSQL is an open source database and utilizes a relational data model. 
The hosting model used is local. 
PostgreSQL can be accessed through java by downloading a PostgreSQL java database connectivity driver.
