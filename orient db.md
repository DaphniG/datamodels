## Orient DB
[Orient DB Website](https://orientdb.org/)

The next database I found was OrientDB. 
The website can be found with this link: https://orientdb.org/ .
Orient DB is known as an open source database. 
It follows the key/value model. 
Orient DB uses cloud as its hosting model. 
We can access Orient DB through java first creating an OrientDB  object that will establish a connection with the OrientDB server. 
After that we need to open a database session and pass in three parameters in order to establish connection.
