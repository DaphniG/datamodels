## Oracle 
[Oracle Website](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/)

The first database product I found was Oracleâ€™s database. 
Their website is: https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/. 
Oracle databases are typically used for commercial purposes. 
The data model for this particular database follows a relational model. 
It uses cloud as its hosting model. 
The oracle database can be accessed through java by first downloading the Oracle java database connectivity drivers. 
Using that driver you can connect that with your java program.
