The next database product I found was IBM db2. 
Their website can be found at https://www.ibm.com/products/db2. 
IBM db2 appears to be used more for commercial purposes. 
IBM db2  follows a relational data model. 
Cloud is a hosting model that IBM db2 uses. 
IBM db2 can be accessed through java by using a java database connectivity driver and connecting 
that to your program by calling the driver manager get connection method.
