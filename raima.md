This ninth database is called Raima. 
Its website is linked above. Its mainly a commerical database. 
This database uses a network model which we havent discussed in class. 
The hosting model can be both embedded or client/server. 
In order to access the Raima database through java a java database connectivty driver will be needed to connect the java program and Raima database.

The network data model is different than all the other models because it allows for representation of complex relationships. 
Although it builds upon the hierarchial model the network model allows for many to many relationships, meaning there can be multiple parent records.
