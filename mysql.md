## MySQL
[MySQL Website](https://www.mysql.com/)

The next database I found was MySQL. 
The website is: https://www.mysql.com/ . 
MySQL's primary use is for commercial purposes. 
It uses a relational model for its database. 
MySQL utilizes a client/server model and an embedded model as its hosting model. 
This database product can be accessed through java by java database database connectivity driver from MySQL.
