## Dgraph
[Dgraph Website](https://dgraph.io/support/ )

The next database I found was Dgraph. 
Its website can be accessed here https://dgraph.io/support/. 
Dgraph can be used as an open source database and uses the graphing data model. 
The hosting model for this database is cloud. Graph can be accessed through by using the Dgraph client. 
This client will then communicate with the server in one of two ways through gRPC or HTTP.
