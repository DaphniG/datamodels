## Aerospike
[Aerospike Website](https://aerospike.com/products/database/)

The next database I found was Aerospike. 
The website for Aerospike can be found here: https://aerospike.com/products/database/. 
It's an open source database. It uses a data model of key/value. 
Its hosting model is cloud. 
Aerospike can be accessed through java by creating an AerospikeClient object with a specified IP address and the port of a seed node.
